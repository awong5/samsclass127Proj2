## Purpose
To develop a very simple buffer overflow exploit in Linux, that alters execution to bypass a password.

This will give you practice with these techniques:
+ Writing very simple C code
+ Compiling with gcc
+ Debugging with gdb
+ Understanding the registers $esp, $ebp, and $eip
+ Understanding the structure of the stack
+ Using Python to create simple text patterns
